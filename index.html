            <li>Aerobic (cardio) activities - stimulate the heart and breathing rate (heart beats faster, breathe harder). They can be moderate or vigorous in their intensity. If performed at a level of intensity that is too high aerobic activities become anaerobic ("without oxygen"). Anaerobic exercise is activity that causes you to be quickly out of breath, like sprinting or lifting a heavy weight.</li>
